## Project Description

#### Problem

How are Julia derived machine learning models pushed to production? In short, is there a simple example that can walk Julia users through the process?

#### Why it needs to be addressed

Data scientists, machine learners, and Julia enthusiasts want to understand how to present learning model outputs via a browser.

#### Proposed Solution

This repository contains code examples, text files, IJulia notebooks, and other general materials related to educating users on how they can build a machine learning prediction model and then allow access of that model via a Web framework like Genie.jl.

It uses the `ScikitLearn.jl` module to:

- produce a machine learning pipeline,
- apply feature engineering to allow for possible `polynomial feature` construction,
- perform scaling via `MinMaxScaler()`,
- select important features using `SelectPercentile()`,
- test scaled features against other well known models like `RandomForestClassifier`,
- apply `GridSearchCV` for testing model `hyperparameters`, and
- reveal the best lerning model

It serializees the derived prediction model using `Julia JLD`

And, finally, in a separate script file `rest.jl`, the project uses the Genie.jl Web framework to render the model via a webpage.

#### Solution Summary

In summary, the project reveals how one might make a Machine Learning module available via a web interface all in Julia without reprogramming the learning model in another language like Java or C (i.e., avoiding the two programming language problem).

The code and examples are purely for educational purposes and were developed as a Proof of Concept (POC). The project's results were used for a Machine Learning Tech Talk for one of Akamai Technologies, Inc's mPulse team's "Learning Tuesdays" team talks, a biweekly talk given by a different member of the Akamai mPulse Data Science team.

## Getting Started

You will need to use the specified Docker image and the repo files or install Julia and IJulia to utilize the Jupyter notebooks and files in this repository.

## Installation Steps

### Using a Docker Container

The code here was run in a Docker container generated from the `jupyter/datascience-notebook` docker image, which provided a nice sandbox environment for running Julia version 1.1.0 code and Jupyter notebooks easily.

Plus, you can easily delete the container and images once finished for those resource focused! :smiley:

#### Pull the Docker Image

#### Installing Docker

Please go [here](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) to see how get Docker installed on your machine if you do not already have it, and to understand common Docker commands needed for the project.

#### Getting the Docker Image

- Open your terminal or command prompt.
- Run the following command to pull the Docker image from DockerHub:
  ```
  docker pull jupyter/datascience-notebook
  ```
  This command downloads the Docker image from DockerHub.

#### **Run the Docker Container**

- Start the Docker container by running the following command from a terminal command line. Adjust the port mapping as needed:

  ```
  docker run --name <what_you_named_the_container> jupyter/datascience-notebook
  ```

  This command builds and runs the container based on the docker image file.

- Add notebook and other files cloned from the repo to your container

  - First download or clone the repo or specific files onto your host machine. You will be able to run the notebook or .jl files
    from within the container this way.

  -To add files that you have stored on your host machine to a Docker container use the `docker cp` command.

  Using `docker cp` at a terminal command line:

  ```
  docker cp <host_path> <container_name_or_id>:<container_path>
  ```

  This command copies files or directories from your host to a running container.

  - <host_path>: The path of the file or directory on your host machine.
  - <container_name_or_id>: The name or ID of the container.
  - <container_path>: The path within the container where you want to copy the files.

  For example,

  ```
  docker cp ./my_file.txt my_container:/path/to/destination
  ```

  copies my_file.txt from your host to /path/to/destination (e.g., /home/project) within the my_container

- Run a Bash shell in the Docker container which will allow you to interact with the container's shell directly.

  At a terminal command line, use the command:

  ```
  docker exec -it <container-name> bash #where <container-name> is the name or ID of the running container.
  ```

  This will open a bash terminal inside the container

- From within this bash terminal, launch the Julia read-eval-print loop (REPL) interactve command line.

  ```
  bash# julia
  ```

- Within the Julia REPL launch the Jupyter notebook by issuing the followng:

  ```
  julia> using IJulia
  julia> notebook()
  ```

- Now you can simply run the copied files or generate a new notebook and replicate the code.

Of course, you can run the code in a notebook or `.jl` scripts after installing Julia and IJulia as outlined below.

### Alternatively, Install Julia and then IJulia to use a Julia Juypter Notebook

You will need at least Julia version 1.1.0 or higher.

1. **juliaup**

A recommended way to install Julia is to install [juliaup](https://github.com/JuliaLang/juliaup) which is a small, self-contained binary that will automatically install the latest stable Julia binary and help keep it up to date. It also supports installing and using different versions of Julia simultaneously.

Install `juliaup` by running this in your terminal:

```
curl -fsSL https://install.julialang.org | sh

```

This will install the latest stable version of Julia, which can be launched from a command-line by typing `julia` as well as the `juliaup` tool. To install different Julia versions see `juliaup --help`.

2. **Downloads**
   If you want to manually download and install specific Julia versions, see the [Downloads](https://julialang.org/downloads/) page.

### Install IJulia to Use Jupyter Notebooks

Install `IJulia` using instructions [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl)

#### Running the Code

To test out the code as is. <br>

1. Run the `julia_ml_2_production_model.ipynb` notebook which will build and save
   your machine learning binary classifier model `cancer_model_jld`

2. next from a command terminal prompt run `$julia runtest.jl`. This action will
   retrieve the classifier model, start the genie.jl webserver and allow you from a browser
   or via `curl` commands to execute REST commands to the server. - for example `curl localhost:8000/sum/2/3?initial_value=10` at the command line
   will yield the value 15. This is a test to make sure all is working - `curl localhost:8000/predict` will actually run a test case of model prediction
   using a predefined benign data set of 30 features.

### Data Sources

The data was obtaind from the `UCI ML Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset`

```
